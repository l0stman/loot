* Prevent memory leaks
* Implement infinite precision arithmetic.
* Implement the error primitive.
* Measure if we need to implement a frame as a hash table or a linked list
  except maybe for the global environment.
* Check that the lvalue is not NULL when analyzing the expression.
* Implement vectors.
* Implement some contruction like let, cond, case, ... as macros.
* Implement the do iteration.
* Implement a buffered I/O.
* Implement ports: position in the file should be included in it.
* Some variables location could be known at analyze time.
* Store the position of the beginning of a syntax to give more 
  meaningful error message.
